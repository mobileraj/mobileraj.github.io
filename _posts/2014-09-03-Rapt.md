- Happiness is a later reflection of memorable accomplishment or result from a worthwhile strenuous activities. According to [mihaly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) csikzentmihalyi - happiness is a later reflection of the flow, rather than the result of the experience at the time.
- Productivity matters even in your free time. 
- The antidote to leisure time ennui is to pay as much attention go scheduling a productive evening or weekend as we do a work day. If not by Sunday you start ruminating of a wasted life...u need activities that is fun but also stretch u. Baruch Spinoza made specs during day, William Blake was a painter etc.

- Rapt focus is central to all forms of fulfilling experiences,
- Decisions require us to think but also move thru the process. Looking at holistically is way more important than piece parts in deciding. Ref to Daniel [Kahneman](https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/)
- The selves of s1 and s2 or the experiencing self vs remembering self play a part in the overall life. Fortune cookie maxim- nothing in life is as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it.

- We base our choices on our evaluations rather than our actual experience - remember that your life is a sum of what you focus on.
- Multi tasking is overrated. It's very inefficient- it's rapid refocus. To get attention piqued you can use coffee or Ritalin or use regimens and exercises to build your focus muscles 
- Ref Larry Stewart of Missouri business men.
- Shift away from unhealthy thoughts and emotions and recast negative events into most productive light possible is the most important of all health habits to cultivate.
- Per Simone Weil - attentiveness without an object is prayer in its supreme form.

Meditation and yoga or alone time each morning with attentive focus on nothingness is key.
