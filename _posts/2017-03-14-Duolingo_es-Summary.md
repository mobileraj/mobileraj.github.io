I learnt few languages growing up in India. Most of them were from my neighboring states in the south. I can speak fluently in Kannada and Tamil (being my mother tongue); comprehend Malayalam and Telugu; read and write Hindi and read Sanskrit.

This was all learnt before 15years of age.

English, itself was hard for me as I sucked at grammar and general writing. I had to work at it by reading various novels from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodline_(Sheldon_novel)">Sydney</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Game_(novel)">Sheldon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_(novel)">Arthur</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moneychangers">Hailey</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead">Ayn</a> <a href="https://www.aynrand.org/novels/atlas-shrugged">Rand</a>, as well as watching movies (which were hard to come by, if it werent for my uncle - Kumar Mama, who was working in Jeddah). I tried reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_from_the_Madding_Crowd">Far from the Madding Crowd</a> and other classics, which I couldnt get through even the first few pages. I finally had to expedite both spoken and written english when I entered <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">IIT Madras </a> and then to <a href="http://missouri.edu/">USA</a>. My journey to the English language is a post in itself...

After coming to states, I envied people who learnt and spoke other languages - from my under grad friends who picked up Chinese or Italian to my older friends who were teaching themselves Russian or Japanese. I accepted the fact that I could never learn a new language if it werent needed (as in survival- Kannada or spoken at home - Tamil). There were times when I have been in NYC or Brooklyn or DC, when Cuban and Costa Rican ladies have come up to me asking for directions in Spanish. I had to sheepishly grin and say <i>I look like one but dont speak it</i>

After having kids and moving to Texas, it became apparent that Spanish was a good weapon to have and language learning was a skill we needed to inculcate in our kids. We encouraged language upon our children. My oldest picked up Spanish in high school, my middle son took 3 years of Latin and my youngest is learning German.

Then last year on a fine Saturday, I was on a bike date with my two younger sons, when my youngest and I made a pact/challenge to speak ONLY in Spanish during the week of Thanksgiving. This was fool hardy, as there was less than a month time and I was nowhere near my language prowess of my son. My middle son became a witness as he remained neutral due to his time being occupied by learning <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/course/ru/en/Learn-Russian-Online">Russian</a> (via Duolingo). Both of them encouraged me to start with <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/course/es/en/Learn-Spanish-Online">Duo</a>.

Then it began...

Although we couldnt do the week of spoken spanish in November, I kept at it making it just part of my day. I had 70+ day streak once, until work and life intervened. But I kept at it. Finally, I am declaring today that I am done with the first pass through the course.

It was not easy. I had to make time. I had to prioritize 15mts or so every day and remind myself to do it -  even if it was 11:30 PM to get that lesson in before  midnight. It became an obsession at first, then a chore and finally second nature.

I will be writing a detailed post of my journey very soon....
