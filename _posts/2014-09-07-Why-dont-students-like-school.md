Based on cognitive principles and research of the author and others like Daniel [Kahneman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman). Same s1 and s2 model, we saw in an older [post](http://mobileraj.github.io/2014/08/20/Thinking-Fast-Slow/).

The System 1 & 2 here are referred to as short-term memory and long-term memory respectively

Cognitive principles and implications

- People are naturally curious but are not naturally good thinkers - start with explaining questions taking answers for granted
- Factual knowledge precedes skill - need facts to think well on topic
- Memory is residue of thought - the lesson or topic must ask what will make my audience think
- We understand new things in context of things we already know - start with shallow knowledge before getting into deep knowledge which is the goal
- Proficiency requires practice 
- Cognition is fundamentally different early and late in training - understand your audience
- Children are more alike than different in terms of learning - think of content not on variation of audience
- Intelligence can be changed through sustained hard work - talk success and failure in form of effort and not ability
- Practice these principles to improve your delivery - improvement requires more than just experience it's about conscious effort and feedback.
