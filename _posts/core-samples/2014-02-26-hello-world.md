This post is my first experiment with Jekyll powered site - thank you [Github](http://github.com). I had a brief romance with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) right before the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) hype cycle. I even have an autographed Ruby [book](http://pragprog.com/book/ruby/programming-ruby) from [Dave Thomas](http://pragdave.me/) himself. And I still follow DHH.

#### About me

>I am curious about how things work, especially the software kind - including brain, cells and programs/systems. I am starting to get into hardware, but there has been no time to get dedicated learning on the likes of arduino or raspberry pi, let alone stamp computing. 

>So most of the work/writings here will be about code snippets, industry observations, videos around sample apps and anything I am excited about around technology.

##### on the web
>You can find about my professional work life [here](http://www.linkedin.com/in/schroskat) and read or follow my [tweets](https://twitter.com/mobileraj1). 
>I have stayed off [Facebook](http://facebook.com) for almost 2 years other than the occasional prod I might get from my family to check out something they had posted etc. I also have started to upload some of my geek play on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/r0x61j/videos)

##### at [IBM](http://ibm.com)
>You can read my older [CV](http://raj.balasubramanians.com/RajResume2011.pdf). Currently I lead mobile cloud services initiatives (as a product manager) around the IBM [BlueMix](http://www.bluemix.net) platform we announced at [Pulse](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/tivoli/pulse/). Let me know if you want to give it a try. I also have responsibility around IBM Worklight product focusing on data on device, analytics, security and integration.

>Prior to that I did consulting around app dev & infrastructure projects for IBM Software Group across variety of disciplines - SOA, BPM, BRM, Portal, EAI etc.

##### phd
>I am trying to continue through my PhD at [University of Texas at Austin](http://wwww.utexas.edu). Its been very tough given work, family and other commitments. Soon, I will write about some research escapades here. For now, all you will know is [here](http://raj.balasubramanians.com/ResearchStmt-2011-1.pdf)
