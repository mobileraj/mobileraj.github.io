## Prologue
As I wrote in the [December post](https://mobileraj.github.io/2021/12/19/Dec-interim-update), our journey to the land started and is progressing slowly. This post is another interim update as we near the end of spring in the Gregorian calendar year of 2022 and look at summer.

I had left you with the garage framed and insulated and waiting on garage doors.

What ensues is the updates in the last few months, through winter and entering into spring of the current year.
 
## Garage operational, almost
We finally got the garage doors and had it installed. This helped with us sealing the concrete floor and the walls complete.

## Got the RV in
We finally were able to get the RV in. We are currently working to connect the water, electric and sewer. We should also have propane soon.

This will be our home for the next several months, God willing as we work the rest.

## The Barn is getting there
We also had the barn almost complete, with the stalls for the animals coming in this week or next. This was a major process as well, given the supply chain issues and getting a design that will eventually house our equines as we grow into them.

## Fences are up 
Atleast in our first paddock, we have fenced for ruminants and cattle and equines as needed. We had started the welding work on the corner posts and few months back when it was dry, part of our patch caught on fire from a wind blowing the welding arc. We were able to contain it and continue with our work. Thank God for all the rain we have gotten to complete the fence without any incidents.

I will provide another update in the next month, when we focus on getting our barn filled with sheep, alpacas, guineas, chickens, rabbits and donkeys, with few livestock gaurd dogs.

None of this could have been possible without the Most High and we continue to thank Almighty for His blessings and the learnings through this process.

Until next time....Godspeed
