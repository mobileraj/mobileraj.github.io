I have had a fascination with Warren Buffett since I landed in US and learned about him form a mentor of mine. Although I had heard of his famous chairman letters and how accessible they were, I was more interested in his bio and other content about him.
I finally broke down this year and started reading his letters which are publicly available on Berkshire Hathaway site.
