<p>Two systems of thinking-</p>

<ul>
<li>Sys1 operates automatically and quickly with little to no effort and no sense of voluntary control</li>

<li>Sys2 allocates attention to the effort flu mental Activities that demand it including complex computations. This sys2 is associated with subjective experience of agency, choice and focus.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prime sys2 so sys1 can engage the right way.</p>

<p>Some key takeaways</p>

<ul>
<li>What you see is all there is - WYSIATI</li>

<li>Mind then is an uneasy interaction of the 2 systems</li>

<li>Sys1 does x means x occurs automatically</li>

<li>Sys2 is mobilized to do y means arousal increases, pupil dilates attention is focused and activity y is performed.</li>
</ul>
