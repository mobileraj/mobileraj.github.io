<p>This post is my first experiment with Jekyll powered site - thank you <a href='http://github.com'>Github</a>. I had a brief romance with <a href='https://www.ruby-lang.org/'>Ruby</a> right before the <a href='http://rubyonrails.org/'>Ruby on Rails</a> hype cycle. I even have an autographed Ruby <a href='http://pragprog.com/book/ruby/programming-ruby'>book</a> from <a href='http://pragdave.me/'>Dave Thomas</a> himself. And I still follow DHH.</p>

<h4 id='about_me'>About me</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>I am curious about how things work, especially the software kind - including brain, cells and programs/systems. I am starting to get into hardware, but there has been no time to get dedicated learning on the likes of arduino or raspberry pi, let alone stamp computing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So most of the work/writings here will be about code snippets, industry observations, videos around sample apps and anything I am excited about around technology.</p>

<p>You can find about my professional work life <a href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/schroskat'>here</a> and read or follow my <a href='https://twitter.com/mobileraj1'>tweets</a>. I have stayed off <a href='http://facebook.com'>Facebook</a> for almost 2 years other than the occasional prod I might get from my family to check out something they had posted etc. I also have started to upload some of my geek play on <a href='http://www.youtube.com/user/r0x61j/videos'>Youtube</a></p>

<p>I am trying to continue through my PhD at <a href='http://wwww.utexas.edu'>University of Texas at Austin</a>. Its been very tough given work, family and other commitments. Soon, I will write about some research escapades here. For now, all you will know is <a href='http://raj.balasubramanians.com/ResearchStmt-2011-1.pdf'>here</a></p>
