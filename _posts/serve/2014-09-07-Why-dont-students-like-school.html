<p>Based on cognitive principles and research of the author and others like Daniel <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman'>Kahneman</a>. Same s1 and s2 model, we saw in an older <a href='http://mobileraj.github.io/2014/08/20/Thinking-Fast-Slow/'>post</a>.</p>

<p>The System 1 &amp; 2 here are referred to as short-term memory and long-term memory respectively</p>

<p>Cognitive principles and implications</p>

<ul>
<li>People are naturally curious but are not naturally good thinkers - start with explaining questions taking answers for granted</li>

<li>Factual knowledge precedes skill - need facts to think well on topic</li>

<li>Memory is residue of thought - the lesson or topic must ask what will make my audience think</li>

<li>We understand new things in context of things we already know - start with shallow knowledge before getting into deep knowledge which is the goal</li>

<li>Proficiency requires practice</li>

<li>Cognition is fundamentally different early and late in training - understand your audience</li>

<li>Children are more alike than different in terms of learning - think of content not on variation of audience</li>

<li>Intelligence can be changed through sustained hard work - talk success and failure in form of effort and not ability</li>

<li>Practice these principles to improve your delivery - improvement requires more than just experience it&#8217;s about conscious effort and feedback.</li>
</ul>
