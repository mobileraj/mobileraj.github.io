<p>Liquid error: No such file or directory - /home/raj/projects/mobileraj.github.io/_posts/_includes I tried the idea index method thanks to <a href='http://calnewport.com/'>Cal</a> who got this via <a href='http://fourhourworkweek.com/'>Tim Feriss blog</a> interviewing <a href='http://www.brainpickings.org/'> Maria</a>, as I read Haruki Murakamis What I talk about running when I talk about running. This book itself was referenced in Cal&#8217;s blog post. True to the method, I tried to keep a page in front of the book and made notes instead of highlighting or not doing anything (which is what I typically do - just read) The result is the page reference in each of the note item.</p>

<p>Jogging every day to strengthen your muscles and you develop your runners physique. Add a stimulus and keep it up and repeat. Patience is a must but this guarantees results. Works for both writing and jogging. Raymond Chandler would sometimes just sit at his desk and think even if not to write, so his habit and endurance is built. Build your focus and endurance early in life, since as you age you need it.</p>
