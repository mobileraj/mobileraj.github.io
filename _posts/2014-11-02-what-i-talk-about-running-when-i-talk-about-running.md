I tried the idea index method thanks to <a href="http://calnewport.com/">Cal</a> who got this via <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/">Tim Feriss blog</a> interviewing <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/"> Maria</a>, as I read Haruki Murakamis What I talk about running when I talk about running. This book itself was referenced in Cal's blog post
