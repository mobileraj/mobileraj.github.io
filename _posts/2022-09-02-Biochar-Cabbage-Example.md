## Prologue
[E3 Biochar](https://tejasbuds.com/e3) has been written about [here](https://tejasbuds.com/more-biochar.html) and [Tejas Buds LLC](https://tejasbuds.com) has been marketing a pure version of this as soil amendment in the Ozarks for homesteaders and home gardeners. This article is about how one of the growers, used E3 biochar along with regenerative soil practices to produce a cabbage crop.


## Setup
The overall setup of this garden is a repurposed front yard lawn, that was conditioned 16 months ago with the following:
    - mowing to reduce grass
    - spread of wood chips evenly across the predefined plot
    - addition of E3 Biochar through out the plot (dusting and spreading and not layering)
    - addition of more wood chips for cover
    - no till or any major soil disturbance using machines

In this plot, which sat through a winter, various vegetables were planted. Tomatoes, beets, turnips, peas and cabbage.
The plot was only watered through rain and any other natural precipitation, and no well/city water.

## Show me the Cabbage
This is a typical harvest of the cabbage crop and this one being on the small-medium side. This weighed 9.6lbs and measured just under 30in in diameter.

As you can see for live compare, we used a typical baseball to show the difference.

The taste and the feel of the cabbage was good and fresh even after leaving it in room temperature for close to a week.

Our belief is that E3 biochar has effected the soil structure over the few seasons in over the year its been in the ground and helped with porosity, nutrient density and facilitating better nutrient transport. This has effected all crops positively, even when rain was scarce and warding off harmfuls and promoting beneficial insects.

## Looking ahead
We plan to do more experiments in controlled plots to show the difference of crops in the same field, where once is treated with biochar and the others are not. This will provide interesting data points for us to come up with actual recommendations for home gardeners.
