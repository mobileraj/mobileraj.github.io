<ul>
<li>Attention and focus are key if we have achieve anything meaningful in this info flooded always on world.</li>

<li>Choosing what to focus on specifically guides your overall experience. Be in the moment paying attention to one thing over many things.</li>

<li>Positive emotion helps in ensuring right focus.</li>

<li>Living a focused life is not about trying to feel happy all the time. But rather treating your mind as a private garden and being mindful of what u take in and allow it to grow.</li>

<li>Research shows what you pay attention yo shapes your brain. So use that throughout your life to keep growing.</li>

<li>Focus on relationships</li>

<li>Story of Tracey Burke who is a polymath. From Maryland to Wyoming where she is a gourmet cook, ranch hand, gardener, runs ea ranch, legal mediation and yoga.she has continually reinvented herself by focus</li>

<li>Happiness is a later reflection of memorable accomplishment or result from a worthwhile strenuous activities. According to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi'>mihaly</a> csikzentmihalyi - happiness is a later reflection of the flow, rather than the result of the experience at the time.</li>

<li>Productivity matters even in your free time.</li>

<li>The antidote to leisure time ennui is to pay as much attention go scheduling a productive evening or weekend as we do a work day. If not by Sunday you start ruminating of a wasted life&#8230;u need activities that is fun but also stretch u. Baruch Spinoza made specs during day, William Blake was a painter etc.</li>

<li>Just don&#8217;t have the time means just don&#8217;t have the self discipline.</li>

<li>Rapt focus is central to all forms of fulfilling experiences,</li>

<li>Decisions require us to think but also move thru the process. Looking at holistically is way more important than piece parts in deciding. Ref to Daniel <a href='https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/'>Kahneman</a></li>

<li>The selves of s1 and s2 or the experiencing self vs remembering self play a part in the overall life. Fortune cookie maxim- nothing in life is as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it. Example of being happy in California vs michigan - as the vast part of what makes up happiness is family relations work etc and small part of weather.</li>

<li>We base our choices on our evaluations rather than our actual experience - remember that your life is a sum of what you focus on.</li>

<li>Multi tasking is overrated. It&#8217;s very inefficient- it&#8217;s rapid refocus. To get attention piqued you can use coffee or Ritalin or use regimens and exercises to build your focus muscles</li>

<li>Ref Larry Stewart of Missouri business men.</li>

<li>Shift away from unhealthy thoughts and emotions and recast negative events into most productive light possible is the most important of all health habits to cultivate.</li>

<li>Per Simone Weil - attentiveness without an object is prayer in its supreme form.</li>

<li>Ref dugu choegyal rinpoche, Richard Alpert to ram das,</li>
</ul>

<p>Meditation and yoga or alone time each morning with attentive focus on nothingness is key.</p>
